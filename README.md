# Don't be a TensorFlow Timmy

Hey there! 👋

Welcome to Tanmay's PyTorch repo!
Here, I've created a safeplace for all my practise of PyTorch that follows along with the awesome tutorials from the official PyTorch site. It’s a great way to learn and play around with deep learning concepts.
Also, I have used these newly learned concepts and put them to test via a series of implementations, the first one being at https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11/overview

## What You’ll Find Here

| Feature                | Description                                       |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| 📓 Jupyter Notebooks    | Hands-on examples based on PyTorch       |
| 🔍 Code Snippets        | Quick implementations        |
| 🛠️ Practice Space       | A place of experiments    |
| Proving grounds         | A place of implementations |


In this repo I have also solved the kaggle Competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11, with a val accuracy of ~93%
Next i will be deploying the same model on the web, using framework of Django. This will teach me how to actually inference a model via the web.
